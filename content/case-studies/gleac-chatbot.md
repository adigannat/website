## Context

GLEAC helps teams build soft skills using AI-guided coaching. Client support relied on email threads and spreadsheets, overwhelming the small operations team. Leadership needed a chatbot that extended the coaching experience and offloaded repetitive guidance.

## Problem

- Support inquiries doubled in Q1 2025 without a matching increase in headcount.
- Knowledge was scattered across Notion, Google Drive, and private Slack threads, making it hard to keep answers consistent.
- Previous automation pilots failed due to insufficient training and lack of measurable feedback loops.

## Approach

1. **Workflow mapping** — Interviewed operations, QA, and customer success teams to map recurring intents and escalation paths. Documented service-level objectives and fallback policies.
2. **Bot implementation** — Stitched together the existing chatbot platform with bespoke analytics. Added guardrails for high-risk responses and configured conversation logging with PII scrubbing.
3. **Training and enablement** — Ran workshops, created video walkthroughs, and produced quick-start guides tailored to each department. Embedded a feedback widget to capture missing answers.
4. **Measurement** — Streamed interaction events into the analytics warehouse. Built Superset dashboards for adoption, response accuracy, and escalation ratios. Set weekly reviews with leadership to iterate on content.

## Results

- 91 percent increase in client interactions handled by the bot within six weeks.
- 33 percent reduction in time waste for customer success representatives, confirmed through time tracking.
- 18 percent drop in escalations due to better routing logic and updated playbooks.
- 96 percent training completion across departments, sustaining adoption after handover.

## Stack

- SaaS chatbot platform integrated with custom webhook middleware.
- Analytics warehouse (BigQuery) funneling interaction metrics to Superset dashboards.
- Change enablement toolkit: Loom training, Slack nudges, and weekly office hours.

- Feedback loops and adoption dashboard samples are available on request.
