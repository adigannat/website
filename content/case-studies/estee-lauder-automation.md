## Context

EstAce Lauder manages procurement for more than 20,000 clients on SAP Ariba. The finance team spent entire sprints reconciling supplier data, updating spreadsheets, and chasing manual approvals. I joined as a digital transformation intern to accelerate these workflows.

## Problem

- Four core processes (supplier onboarding, invoice validation, exception handling, reporting) consumed 70 percent of analyst capacity.
- Manual edits introduced inconsistent data, requiring late-night corrections before quarterly closes.
- Leadership demanded visibility into automation efficacy before approving further investment.

## Approach

1. **Process mining** — Collected Ariba event logs, mapped frequent paths, and quantified delays. Identified the top five friction points responsible for 62 percent of wasted hours.
2. **Automation design** — Built RPA bots for onboarding and invoice validation using UiPath, with deterministic fallbacks to the analyst queue. Wrote custom Python scripts for bulk data reconciliation with checksum validation.
3. **Quality loops** — Introduced QA checklists, version-controlled scripts, and automated regression runs on anonymized data before deployment.
4. **Reporting** — Surfaced automation status in Power BI dashboards, showing cycle time, savings, and exceptions by team.

## Results

- 48 percent reduction in repetitive work across four automation flows.
- 20,000+ client records maintained with higher accuracy and fewer escalations.
- Cycle time for invoice validation dropped from 3.5 days to 18 hours.
- Finance leadership approved expansion to two additional processes backed by the savings data.

## Stack

- UiPath bots orchestrating SAP Ariba web flows.
- Python scripts for reconciliation and QA checks.
- Power BI dashboards for operations and leadership visibility.
